// things I need help with
  // figure out why I can't refresh RecipieDetails or go directly there with the link
    // I suspect I need to pass 1 recipie to RedipieDetails
      // but we don't know which recipie to pass until it gets there.
      // maybe useContext will solve this problem
  // Add recipie redirect works, but it won't load(probably the same problem as ^^^^)

// things I might need help with
  // fix remove button and add back in (commented out broken code on form components)

// things to do
  // add a category feature to the RecipiePage to filter by category, maybe a sort as well
    // sort by name, time, calories, servings

// future goals
  // duplicate recipies
  // edit recipies
    // maybe any edit makes a duplicate, and then you can delete previous versions later later
      // (or, be asked if you want to delete previous version or keep previous version)
      // also, you could use navlinks and routes to display the different versions
  // delete recipies
  // add a createdAt key in the db
  // maybe add a (pseudo)login feature
  // add a favorite recipies "âœ°" button(grab star from GregsList(mock code challenge))
  // I'd like to turn the navbar into a square with three lines that opens the navbar and animates to an x
  // add RecipieNotes component
  // add an area to display notes in state, and a form to add new notes
    // gonna need a patch request and text area for notes on the RecipieDetails
